## An explorable explanation of the Iowa Gambling Task

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was created in 1994 to supplement an understanding of how humans make decisions involving risk. Particularly, IGT was originally developed in order to assess the relationship in decision-making outcomes for those who suffer from ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage (VMPFC) :cite[@Bechara1994]. Through the useful information produced as a result, the task has since been expanded to provide insight in the decision making of other clinical populations, like those with substance addictions or people with schizophrenia (Brand et al., 2005).

## Set-up of the Task

The original IGT begins with an individual given $2000 to ‘gamble’ with. The individual is told that the objective of the task is to maximize profit through a series of 100 trials, where during each trial, they would select a card from four separate decks. When flipped, each card unpredictably has a number representing the amount of money to be added or deducted from the individual’s starting sum of money. The individual will continue to flip cards until they have completed the series of trials.

Each of the decks are organized such that those that present greater sums on a gain (+$100) result in a long-term loss, while those with lesser gains (+$50) result in long-term gain. The decks have predetermined gain and loss patterns. The outcomes of each deck are not known to the individual before attempting the task, so they must learn from experience which choices would benefit them most.

Through what is effectively a simulation of gambling, researchers may deduce an individual's propensity to risk. Though the immediate winnings of a given deck are attractive in the moment, would an individual be able to cultivate an understanding of their position relative to the objective of maintaining a profit through the duration of the task?

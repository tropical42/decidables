## Conclusion

The IGT has been studied thoroughly to garner a better understanding of human behavior under situations involving risk. It has allowed for a stronger understanding of various parts of the brain and their function with decision-making behavior.  Individuals rely on a combination of rational and emotional responses to help determine which choices they should make while completing the IGT. Individuals learning how the task functions has been foundational in understanding the results, though in the future - as evidenced through the SGT - there should be work done to determine how significant the learning process is. 

Recently, gambling has become increasingly relevant in society. Through technological advances, it has become incredibly simple for people to gamble. With these advances, there may be opportunity for the scope of the IGT to be expanded. Decision-making behavior may vary greatly across the different mediums that people are able to gamble. Sports betting, online casinos, and speculative currency (like cryptocurrency) all may produce different insights with regard to risk and decision-making processes. It is especially important to continue researching these mediums, as an increase in gambling activity coincides with various negative outcomes. Gambling is an addictive activity with potentially life-altering consequences. With a better understanding of human behavior, there may be options to prevent certain choices from being made.

In the trials that you have completed and the following analysis, hopefully you have learned about the mechanics of the task and how they are relevant to several important research topics today.

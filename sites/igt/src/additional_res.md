## Additional Influence

Emotions and rationality are not the only factors at play with research involving the IGT. The IGT continued to be conducted to examine the decision-making behaviors of individuals facing different circumstances, such as:

- Lesions in the right somatosensory and insular cortex :cite[@10.1093/brain/123.11.2189],
- Huntington's disease :cite[@stout_rodawalt_siemers_2001]
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder :cite[@da_rocha_2011]
- and Asperger's syndrome (Johnson, Yechiam, Murphy, Stout, & Busemeyer, 2004). :cite[@doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01646.x]

With the results of each study concluding similar findings to the original experiment - the above groups facing some degree of challenge in decision-making behavior. As mentioned previously, a deficit in decision-making ability was categorized as an individual's inability to *learn* the IGT. Participants suffering from the aforementioned circumstances typically took preference to large immediate gains without acknowledgement to the losses that they would incur. They are unable to learn that the decks with small gains eventually yield a net gain.

## Substances

One may assume that certain substances are instrumental in the process of decision-making behavior, too. In other iterations of the IGT, researchers found patterns of similar consequence in the performance of those taking the IGT with damage to the :term[VMPFC] and those with a dependency to substances. Alcohol is a depressant that has a vast range of effects on the brain. Those who experience alcohol use disorder typically perform poorly in the IGT, displaying a lack of impulse control. Gambling disorder, which involves an addiction to gambling, exhibits similar results. Research suggests that both alcohol use disorder and gambling disorder underscore a mechanism in the ventral tegmental area responsible for processing reward inputs - the nucleus accumbens :cite[@kovacs_decision_2017]. Using the IGT, participants from a pool of those with alcohol disorder and gambling disorder both displayed significant impairment in decision-making, with the group of gambling disorder participants performing worse.

## The Soochow Gambling Task

The Soochow Gambling Task (SGT), a variation of the IGT, disputes the idea that success in the IGT is dictated by an individual's ability to understand future consequences. Typically, the way the IGT is analyzed is by combining the participants selections from both the *winning* and *losing* decks (net gain, net loss) :cite[@Bechara1994]. The study by :cite[@upton_comparing_2012] created the SGT to circumvent the obscurity of this analysis so that the win :term[frequency] was also involved, as the original IGT analysis does not account for the number of times an individual continues to win. The SGT was designed to incorporate this through having the positive expected value decks generate wins at a *lower* frequency. In doing so, the results from the SGT indicate that healthy individuals perform similarly to what was observed when the IGT was attempted by drug users. Both a healthy control group and a drug user test group showed preference to the frequency of wins; rather than a discrepancy in learning, the SGT displays that perhaps individuals are just attracted to the choices with more chances to win. Where the original IGT places emphasis on the behavioral differences in participant groups, the SGT offers a new iteration that examines an individual's preference for win frequency.

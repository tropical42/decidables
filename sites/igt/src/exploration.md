## Exploring the Model of the Gambling Task

This is where you can explore the Iowa Gambling Task yourself. Similarly to the original task, you will begin with $2000 and attempt to produce a profit. Clicking on each deck will flip a card that will either add or subtract from your total. As you go through the task, you may look at your total to see how you are doing. If you wish, you may click the 'Reset' button to begin over again. 

This iteration of the IGT involves 40 trials, so do your best to make some money within that period. The results you achieve will be discussed in detail in the *Theory* section.

## Neuropsychology of the IGT

Now that you have completed the task, we can analyze your results.

Findings from the original IGT task - where the participants selected were people suffering from brain injury to :term[VMPFC] - conclude that those who cannot produce a profit through the trials may exhibit decision-making impairments by means of their injuries. Damage to this area of the brain is associated with a syndrome, where an otherwise average individual faces significant challenges moderating their risk taking in decision-making behavior :cite[@Bechara1994]. 

Decision-making behavior in a complex task like the IGT requires the participant to *learn* about the choices they are making in order to succeed with the objective. Once an individual is able to detect that the options from the first two decks accumulate greater loss, they should switch to the ‘safer’ options. Influences on decision-making behaviors and learning are still fairly underdetermined. One argument regarding the IGT is that decision-making is dependent on the individual's ability to conduct rational, Bayesian maximization of 'expected utility'. Originally based on the balance one would incur of pain and pleasure as a consequence of their decision-making, expected utility refers to an individual's value of wealth on the balance :cite[@Bechara2005]. The Expectancy Valence Model expands on the economical idea of expected utility, and The :cite[@Wetzels2009] study of it suggests that individuals use three psychological processes to guide their choices:

"The attention to losses versus rewards, the rate with which new information updates old expectancies, and the extent to which people make decisions that are consistent with their internal evaluations"

Other approaches to learning about decision-making contend that emotion is often neglected in these studies and is instrumental in learning and analyzing risk. The 'Somatic Marker Hypothesis' :cite[@Bechara2005] argues that the deficits encountered as a result of VMPFC damage relate to an emotional mechanism responsible for a substantial role in the learning processes of risk and future consequence. Absence of some of these structures involved with decision-making reduces an individual's ability to discern between beneficial options, and reduce the quality of choices they make respective to future consequence.

It is reasonable to assume that there are many factors of influence involved when the IGT is attempted. The IGT is still frequently used to assess different studies regarding decision-making and its relationship with risk. Several developments of the IGT have been made to fine-tune results to more specific populations.
